# Question Duplication checker : Iamneo.ai

## Problem Statement: 
Neo exam is one of the important products of iamneo.ai. This is a B2B product which helps organizations to conduct exams to fulfil their requirements as per their needs. The preparation of the questions is being done by the Neo Elon team in our organization. Neo Elon team is responsible for preparing questions, question banks and solutions for the prepared question for evaluation purpose. The prepared question is then being displayed to the client. The team prepared almost 20 kinds of questions as of now. 

However, sometimes the question being prepared gets repeated and stored in the database and the same gets displayed on the client side i.e., the repeated questions. This results in duplicated or exact copies of the question being present in the question bank that the client receives.  This is also responsible of taking up extra spaces in our database.

This is a project as a part of our internal tech optimization and helping Neo Elon team not facing the duplicate question problem.
